# react-movie-challengue
We want to create a Movie App with React

API to be used: https://www.omdbapi.com/ 
You should get your API Key from the web page, signing your email, and use it to fetch.

Requirements:

✅ It has to show an input to filter the list of movies, and a buton to perform the search.

✅ It shows the movies, the title, year and the Image.

✅ It has to show a loading when searching

✅ It has to be a form, and validate that it has at least 3 characters

✅ It has to be a responsive grid of movies

-----------------------------------------

Suggestions:

✅ Prevent the same search from being done twice in a row. (useRef)

✅ Make the search automatically when you type.

✅ Avoide searching continuously when typing (with debounce or useTransition)

✅ use minimal css; ui css library or components is not needed.

We recommend this stack:
 Typescript, Vite, ESLint, Jest
